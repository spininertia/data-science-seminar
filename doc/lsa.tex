Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a methodology for extracting and representing hidden contextual relation between words and topics by statistical techniques\cite{landauer1998introduction}. LSA is typically applied to large volume of text corpus, and it can often discover contextual relations between words even if they haven't appeared together. (More illustration of LSA's idea).
