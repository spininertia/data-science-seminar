Topic Model has been a successful tool for managing large text data set in different fields. For example, it's been applied to index latent \emph{term} in Information Retrieval\cite{deerwester1990indexing}, which proves its power to mining hidden states. Different models and algorithms are have been proposed during its development, for example, \cite{dumais1995latent}, \cite{blei2003latent}and\cite{hofmann1999probabilistic}. The report will focus that representative results to give a detailed overview of this field.
